> ## About the Project
> **Football Trivia** is a questionnaire-style web app that allows users to test their football knowledge with questions of varying difficulty.

This project was built to support my learning journey with **Next.js (React)**. Creating this app gave me the opportunity to explore a new technology while building something based on one of my biggest passions,*"the beautiful game."*

Through this process, I developed fundamental knowledge of React, including working with components, props, and hooks. It helped me establish a solid baseline for building more interactive React web applications in the future.

## Technologies 

- Next JS (React)
- CSS 
- Vercel (For hosting)


## Here's how it looks üëÄ




## How to play

1. Click 'Start'
2. Select your preferred difficulty option
3. Click 'Play Anthem' to listen to music as you test your knowledge
4. Good Luck! üôå

** The work isn‚Äôt over yet! üõ†Ô∏è**

### Next task:
- [ ] Implement a randomiser for my difficulty selector (Allowing the user to choose a random level)
- [ ] Implement a randomiser for my questions (Allowing questions to be displayed in a random order)

## What i've learned so far
- [ ] Building reusable components (QuestionPage, DifficultySelector, PlayAnthemBttn)
- [ ] Managing state changes with useState and useEffect
- [ ] Usage of local storage to store difficulty levels

> ## About the Project
> **Football Trivia** is a questionnaire-style web app that allows users to test their football knowledge with questions of varying difficulty.

This project was built to support my learning journey with **Next.js (React)**. Creating this app gave me the opportunity to explore a new technology while building something based on one of my biggest passions,*"the beautiful game."*

Through this process, I developed fundamental knowledge of React, including working with components, props, and hooks. It helped me establish a solid baseline for building more interactive React web applications in the future.

## Technologies 

- Next JS (React)
- CSS 
- Vercel (For hosting)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


# ‚öΩ Football Trivia

> *How well do you really know the "beautiful game"?*  
>  
> *Football Trivia built using NextJs (React), CSS and hosted on Vercel.*
>
> ## About the Project
> **Football Trivia** is a questionnaire-style web app that allows users to test their football knowledge with questions of varying difficulty.

This project was built to support my learning journey with **Next.js (React)**. Creating this app gave me the opportunity to explore a new technology while building something based on one of my biggest passions,*"the beautiful game."*

Through this process, I developed fundamental knowledge of React, including working with components, props, and hooks. It helped me establish a solid baseline for building more interactive React web applications in the future.

## Technologies 

- Next JS (React)
- CSS 
- Vercel (For hosting)


## Here's how it looks üëÄ




## How to play

1. Click 'Start'
2. Select your preferred difficulty option
3. Click 'Play Anthem' to listen to music as you test your knowledge
4. Good Luck! üôå

** The work isn‚Äôt over yet! üõ†Ô∏è**

### Next task:
- [ ] Implement a randomiser for my difficulty selector (Allowing the user to choose a random level)
- [ ] Implement a randomiser for my questions (Allowing questions to be displayed in a random order)

## What i've learned so far
- [ ] Building reusable components (QuestionPage, DifficultySelector, PlayAnthemBttn)
- [ ] Managing state changes with useState and useEffect
- [ ] Usage of local storage to store difficulty levels
- [ ] Handling user events
- [ ] Deploying with Vercel

## Testing
- [ ] Complete Home Page Unit Testing
- [ ] Complete GamePlay Unit Testing
- [ ] Complete Unit Testing
